## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# 1. Build and upload firmware
pio run --target upload --environment esp32dev

# 2. Verify compilation success
echo $? # Should return 0

# 3. Check memory usage
pio run --target size
# RAM:   [====      ]  XX.X% (used XXXXX bytes from XXXXXX bytes)
# Flash: [======    ]  XX.X% (used XXXXXX bytes from XXXXXXX bytes)
```

### Step 2: Initial Configuration
```cpp
// Connect to ESP32 via Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
// Configure network settings:
config_wifi "YourNetworkName" "YourSecurePassword123"
config_server "192.168.1.100" 3003
save_config

// Verify configuration
status
wifi
test

// Reboot to apply settings
reboot
```

### Step 3: Operational Validation
```cpp
// After reboot, verify system status:
status    // Should show all systems connected
sensor    // Verify sensor readings are reasonable  
gps       // Check GPS coordinates if available
test      // Confirm server connectivity

// Monitor telemetry in dashboard
// Should see data packets every 3 seconds
```

### Step 4: Stress Testing
```bash
# 1. Extended Operation Test (24 hours minimum)
# Monitor for memory leaks, connection stability

# 2. Network Interruption Test
# Disconnect WiFi for 5 minutes, verify auto-recovery

# 3. Server Outage Test  
# Stop dashboard server for 10 minutes, verify graceful handling

# 4. Power Cycle Test
# Power off/on 10 times, verify configuration persistence
```

## 🚨 FAILURE CRITERIA & ROLLBACK

### Critical Failures (Immediate Rollback Required):
- [ ] **System Hangs**: Watchdog resets occurring regularly
- [ ] **Memory Corruption**: Heap grows continuously without bound
- [ ] **Connection Failures**: Cannot establish network connectivity
- [ ] **Data Loss**: Telemetry packets consistently failing to transmit
- [ ] **Sensor Errors**: Critical sensors (GPS/INA219) completely non-functional
- [ ] **Command Interface Broken**: Serial commands not responding

### Warning Conditions (Monitor Closely):
- [ ] **Intermittent Disconnections**: > 5% packet loss over 1 hour
- [ ] **Slow Performance**: Loop iterations > 5ms average
- [ ] **Memory Growth**: Heap usage increasing > 1% per hour
- [ ] **GPS Signal Loss**: No satellite lock for > 30 minutes in clear conditions
- [ ] **Sensor Drift**: Battery readings outside expected ranges consistently

### Rollback Procedure:
```bash
# 1. Flash original firmware
pio run --target upload --target erase

# 2. Upload ESP32_UAV_MASTER.ino (original)
# Note: Will lose secure configuration features

# 3. Reconfigure network manually in source code
# Edit ssid/password variables before upload

# 4. Document failure conditions for analysis
